# odin-testing-1

This project is about learning how to write tests and working with npm and jest to run these tests. For this project, I will be creating 5 JavaScript programs (capitalise.js, reverseString.js, calculator.js, analyseArray.js, caesarCipher.js) and then creating a testing suite to test these programs. 

Through this project I learned:

1) the pros and cons about Test Driven Development(TDD)
2) how to write tests for JavaScript programs
3) how to write tests in Jest and how to use common Jest matchers
4) how to write programs with testing in mind to allow for more modular code
5) using command line to execute and check tests.
